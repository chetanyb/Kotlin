# My Kotlin Learnings

## Introduction
This repository is a personal documentation of my journey learning Kotlin. Inspired by Philipp Lackner's YouTube playlist 'KOTLIN NEWBIE TO PRO' and the official Kotlin documentation, it contains various projects and examples reflecting my progress and exploration of Kotlin.

## Topics Covered
Each project in this repository represents a different concept or aspect of Kotlin that I've explored. Here are some of the key topics covered, aligned with the structure of Philipp Lackner's tutorial series:

- Basics of Kotlin programming
- Understanding variables and data types
- Exploring arrays and collections
- Deep dive into Kotlin functions and classes
- Working with control flow (if, when, loops)
- Advanced concepts like generics and higher-order functions
